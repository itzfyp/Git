### Git files structure

 

Git has three main sections which illustrated in below picture

`git directory` git stores your codes \( metadata and object data \) in git directory while cloning from remote repository.

`working directory` when we are checking out a branch, git will pull out a copy of stored code from git directory and store in local system for you to use or modify.

`staging area` this is a simple file to store the information modified files which will go into your next commit.
