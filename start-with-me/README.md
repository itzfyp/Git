# Start with Me

we start with creating new repository locally and do changes to learn Git.

Lets create a new directory where the git repository will live

```text
// new directory
mkdir gitInit

// move to gitInit folder
cd gitInit  
```

Now initialize a brand new git repository in created folder

```text
git init
```

you will see below message while initialising a new git repository locally.

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/itzfyp/gitInit/.git/
```

You can check for the current status of the git repository by using

```text
âžœ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

Now go to respective folder. And there you can see a hidden folder `.git` which has basic git configuration of your repository.

So far, We have created a folder which initialised with git. Hence we will learn other process like add, commit, stage and push files to your repository.
